### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I recently did my bachelor thesis in bioinformatics where I used different machine learning approaches to analyse a longitudinal dataset of severe COVID-19 patients.


ðŸŒ± I'm currently using the book "Hands on Machine Learning with SciKit-Learn and TensorFlow" to expand my technical skills in Machine Learning with Python.
